        <h1>Mohammad Rafsun Jany</h1>
        <p> <strong>I'm Mohammad Rafsun Jany.</strong>  My home town is Narsingdi. Now I'm living near new airport in Dhaka for 8 years. I completed my S.S.C. in 2010 and H.S.C. in 2012 from Narsingdi. <em> I completed my graduation from BGMEA University of Fashion & Technology in Textile Manufacture & Technology.</em> <br> Though I completed my graduation in garments sector but I want to turn from this sector and want to establish me as a professional Web Design & Developer.<u> I know web design & development is very hard to learn.</u>  But I'm prepare to struggle to learn it dedicatedly. Because coding is very interesting to me. And I believe that nothing is hard if anyone has patient and tries heart and soul.</p>
